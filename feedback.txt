1. Assignment Feedback
----------------------
a) What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	I learned how to program decently in Java. I also improved my skills in 
	object-oriented programming overall. I learned to create a game entirely 
	on my own.

----------------------
b) What was easy about this assignment?

	Completing all the players and game except for goodPlayer() once I 
	established a plan for what I needed to do.

----------------------
c) What was harder than you originally thought?

	The code to check for a winning move and goodPlayer() were both harder.

----------------------
d) What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	Give a lecture on how to develop a decent strategy for goodPlayer().

----------------------
e) What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	Create a GUI to display the output, rather than just using standard 
	output. If the human could interact by mouse click, that would've 
	been interesting. However, that would be too time consuming and the 
	class didn't learn GUI yet.

----------------------
f) What other issues would you like to discuss?

	The try submission process was difficult when I couldn't find the 
	differences between my output and the correct output. That was for 
	test case #12, more specifically.
